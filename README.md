# decimal-niner
The goal of this project is to provide realistic simulated air traffic control communications between controllers and aircraft flight crew for the X-Plane 12 plugin Traffic Global (JustFlight).

## decimal-niner Core Principles

- All dependecies must be Open Source
- No dependencies on any subscription based software
- No online requirement for application execution
- Compatibility with Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac and Linux distros

This application has no affinity or relationship with JustFlight or Laminar Research.

Dependencies:
    X-Plane 12 version 12.4.0+
    Traffic Global for X-Plane 12 version TBD
    Sox version xxx
    Piper TTS version xxx

Troubleshooting:
    Your aircraft must have a radio tuned to a frequency in order to hear anything.
    Search decimal-niner output for "error"

Common Issues:
    For sox error "no default audio device" on Microsoft Windows, set environment variable AUDIODRIVER to waveaudio i.e. set AUDIODRIVER=waveaudio
