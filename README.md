# decimal-niner
The goal of this project is to provide realistic simulated air traffic control communications between controllers and aircraft flight crew for X-Plane 12 traffic injection plug-ins.

## Currently Supported Plug-ins

- Traffic Global (JustFlight)

## Requirements

- X-Plane 12 version 12.4.0+
- Traffic Global for X-Plane 12 version TBD

## Supported Operating Systems

- Microsoft Windows
- Apple Mac
- Linux

## decimal-niner Core Principles

- All dependecies must be Open Source
- No dependencies on any subscription based software or cloud services
- No 'online' requirement for application execution
- Compatibility with all supported X-Plane desktop operating systems (Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac and Linux)

## Dependencies

- Sox version xxx
- Piper TTS version xxx

## Troubleshooting

- Your aircraft must have a radio tuned to a frequency in order to hear anything.
Search decimal-niner output for "error"

### Common Issues
- For sox error "no default audio device" on Microsoft Windows, set environment variable AUDIODRIVER to waveaudio i.e. set AUDIODRIVER=waveaudio
